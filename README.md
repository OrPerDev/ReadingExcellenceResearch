This GIT repository is a jupyter notebook for an introduction to Data Science course final project.

Assuming we were a huge books publisher and a writer came to us with a book, how could we know if this book will be successful? Also if we were to be the authors of the book, could we ever know if the book will get the audience sympathy or even reach the cinema theatres? To answer the following questions we set a goal to our research: to see if we can build a model that will predict if a book is so successful that it will also be awarded by list of books features.

The project's main objective was to find what are the "ingredients" to create a successful book that will win official awards.

Explanations for the project and preview can be found in this youtube tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QQ7wPMjiM4 .
